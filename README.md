# ECommerceApplication_SpringBoot_JPA-Angular_Hibernate 

## Scenario
In this project, I simulated the task of modernizing a travel agency's legacy back-end, which was plagued by undocumented bugs and technical debt. Using the Java Spring Framework, I aimed to migrate mission-critical functionalities from the outdated system to ensure stability and future growth.

## Features
- **Java Spring Framework:** I leveraged the Spring Framework to create a robust and modern back-end foundation.
- **Integration with Angular Front-End:** I ensured seamless integration of the back-end with the existing Angular front-end, providing a cohesive user experience.
- **Spring Data JPA:** I used Spring Data JPA for efficient data access and management.
- **Hibernate ORM:** I utilized Hibernate as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the MySQL database, ensuring seamless data persistence and retrieval.
- **RESTful API:** I exposed RESTful APIs for essential functions like checkout and vacation packages listing.
- **MySQL Database:** I used a MySQL database for reliable data storage and retrieval.
- **Validation:** I implemented robust input validation to ensure data integrity and adherence to requirements.
- **Sample Data:** I programmatically added five sample customers to the application for testing purposes.
