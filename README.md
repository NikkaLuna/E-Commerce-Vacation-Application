# E-Commerce Vacation Application

## Project Overview

The E-Commerce Vacation Application is a full stack web-based platform built with Java Spring Boot for the backend and Angular for the frontend. It enables users to browse and purchase vacation and excursion packages online.

## Features

- **Java Spring Framework**: Leverages Spring Framework to create a robust and modern back-end foundation.
- **Integration with Angular Front-End**: Connects the backend with the Angular front-end through RESTful APIs, ensuring seamless data flow and user interactions.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Allows for easy integration with a MySQL database to store and retrieve vacation package information.
- **Rest Repositories:** Provides RESTful APIs for accessing and manipulating vacation packages and customer checkouts.
- **Hibernate ORM**: Utilizes Hibernate as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the MySQL database, ensuring accurate data persistence and data fetching.
- **MySQL Database**: Uses a MySQL database for reliable data storage and retrieval.
- **Lombok:** Reduces boilerplate code in entity classes and improves code readability.
- **Postman Integration:** Utilizes Postman to test API endpoints and ensure proper functionality of writing to the database and retrieving responses.
- **Validation:** Validation is enforced to ensure that the inputs needed by the Angular front-end are correct.
