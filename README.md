# ECommerceApplication_SpringBoot_JPA-Angular_Hibernate 

## Project Overview
The ECommerce Application is a comprehensive solution designed to facilitate the online sale of vacation packages. It combines the power of Java Spring Boot for the backend and Angular for the frontend to deliver a seamless user experience. This application demonstrates the use of modern web development technologies to create a scalable and efficient e-commerce platform.

### ECommerce Application Interface

*This screenshot demonstrates the user interface of the ECommerce application for vacation packages. The left side of the image displays the front-end interface where users can browse various vacation packages, with options for destinations such as Italy, Greece, France, Belgium, Brazil, South Dakota, Nashville, and Wisconsin, each with respective prices. The cart section on the right allows users to specify the party size and view the total cost before proceeding to checkout. The right side of the image shows the developer tools console in Chrome, indicating the application's data service operations, such as fetching customer details and cart items. Although I did not design the front end, I developed and integrated the entire backend using Java Spring Boot and connected it to the front end through RESTful APIs.*

## Features
- **Java Spring Framework:** I leveraged the Spring Framework to create a robust and modern back-end foundation.
- **Integration with Angular Front-End:** I ensured seamless integration of the back-end with the Angular front-end, providing a cohesive user experience.
- **Spring Data JPA:** I used Spring Data JPA for efficient data access and management.
- **Hibernate ORM:** I utilized Hibernate as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the MySQL database, ensuring seamless data persistence and retrieval.
- **RESTful API:** I exposed RESTful APIs for essential functions like checkout and vacation packages listing.
- **MySQL Database:** I used a MySQL database for reliable data storage and retrieval.
- **Validation:** I implemented robust input validation to ensure data integrity and adherence to requirements.
- **Sample Data:** I programmatically added five sample customers to the application for testing purposes.
