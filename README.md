*The RESTful API architecture enables the frontend user interface to request and receive the necessary data from the backend services, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.  I developed and integrated the entire backend using Java Spring Boot and connected it to the front end through RESTful APIs.*


## Features

- **Java Spring Framework**: I leveraged the Spring Framework to create a robust and modern back-end foundation.
- **Integration with Angular Front-End**: I connected the backend with the Angular front-end through RESTful APIs, ensuring seamless data flow and user interactions.
- **Spring Data JPA**: I used Spring Data JPA for efficient data access and management.
- **Hibernate ORM**: I utilized Hibernate as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the MySQL database, ensuring seamless data persistence and retrieval.
- **RESTful API**: I exposed RESTful APIs for essential functions like checkout and vacation packages listing.
- **MySQL Database**: I used a MySQL database for reliable data storage and retrieval.
- **Validation**: I implemented robust input validation to ensure data integrity and adherence to requirements.
- **Sample Data**: I programmatically added five sample customers to the application for testing purposes.
